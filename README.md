Facial recognition is a technology that can automatically identify an individual from a photo or video. The first purposes are related to authentication; for example, when you unlock your phone by showing your face to the camera.
Beyond simple biometric identification, it is of course a powerful tool for monitoring individuals; no need for electronic bracelets equipped with GPS, cameras are everywhere.
Today, it has become relatively easy to detect a face, the tools are relatively powerful as long as you can see at least both eyes, so with a face more or less in front.

To design an example of a facial recognition program, I based myself on a site whose link is : 

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/

it allowed me to download a program already ready and with which I was able to make a small improvement consisting in recognizing the number of people present with the names of the known persons.
